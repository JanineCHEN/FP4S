FP4S: Floor plan image segmentation via scribble-based semi-weakly-supervised learning

Official code and instructions for [**"Floor Plan Image Segmentation Via Scribble-Based Semi-Weakly Supervised Learning: A Style and Category-Agnostic Approach"**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4727643)

The paper has been submitted to **Automation in Construction** and is currently under peer review.

The authors will make the annotated floor plan image datasets, the model code and the model weights of the best performance available for future research soon.

### Introduction
This project introduces a scribble-based semi-weakly-supervised framework for floor plan image segmentation, merging weakly annotated and unlabeled images to boost model robustness and generalizability. This framework benefits from a simplified annotation process while retaining detailed information. Accordingly, we provide a new benchmark dataset for floor plan image parsing covering a wide range of architectural styles and categories.

### Dataset
Coming soon...
